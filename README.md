# Website for Sigma Eta Pi

## Introduction

I was given the assignment of revamping my professional fraternity's website. This is my first draft of the website. The website has since been worked on by other developers in the fraternity and I admit it now looks much better. The website can be accessed at [www.sepatucla.com](https://www.sepatucla.com/). 

## Technologies

This website is made entirely in Vue.js
 
## Instructions to run website:
